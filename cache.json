          "description": "01 背景\n1.1 初识混沌工程\n首先我们先了解一下什么是混沌工程？简单而言，混沌工程是在系统上进行实验的技术手段，目的是建立对系统抵御生产环境中失控条件的能力以及信心。这主要体现在两个方面，从系统角度来讲，混沌工程可以提升我们架构的容错能力和韧性，降低故障发生率和复发率，提升系统用户在使用时的体验；从人员角度来讲，通过混沌工程我们可以加深对架构的理解，在处理故障时能提高整体的应急效率，并且能主动去探究系统中潜在的一些问题。\n混沌工程最早可以追溯到2008年，当时奈飞公司（Netflix）因数据库故障造成了一次巨大的损失，于是他们便围绕着稳定性体系做出了一些探索和建设。直到2015年，混沌工程的理念才被奈飞正式的提出。2019年，阿里云推出了开源工具Chaos Blade；2020年，PingCAP开源了Chaos Mesh，这也标志着国内在混沌工程领域也有了成熟的产品。\n\n1.2 现状\n下面是当前美团数据库运维的一些现状，这里从五个维度展开：首先集群规模（包括集群的大小和数量）的线性增长；第二，集群访问量的持续增加，当然这也是美团业务增长的必然结果；第三，线上遇到的故障种类也越来越多；第四，单位时间故障的影响也越来越大；第五，一些小概率事件的发生也随着集群规模的扩大成为了可能。\n\n1.3 痛点&作用\n基于以上的问题，我们整体上对于数据库集群的稳定性要求也越来越高。所以，围绕着稳定性建设，数据库团队在故障的预防、发现、分析、恢复以及事后复盘5个方面做了很多工作。其中在故障预防方面，我们会通过故障演练探索不同故障场景对我们业务的影响，提升故障发生时业务系统整体的容错能力。早期的时候，我们通过人工的方式来做故障演练，但人工演练在以下四个方面存在很大的问题：\n\n\n在演练场景方面，人工演练能演练的场景比较少，演练场景的复杂度也比较高；\n在演练覆盖率方面，人工演练无法覆盖大多数的集群…",
