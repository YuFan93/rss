          "description": "1 容灾介绍\n我们通常会把故障分为三大类，一是主机故障，二是机房故障，三是地域故障。每类故障都有各自的诱发因素，而从主机到机房再到地域，故障发生概率依次越来越小，而故障的影响却越来越大。\n容灾能力的建设目标是非常明确的，就是要能够应对和处理这种机房级和地域级的大规模故障，从而来保障业务的连续性。近几年，业界也发生了多次数据中心级别的故障，对相关公司的业务和品牌产生了非常大的负面影响。当前容灾能力已经成为众多IT企业建设信息化系统的必选项。\n\n2 业务容灾架构\n2.1 容灾架构演进\n容灾架构从最早期的单活形态（同城主备）到同城多活形态，再演化到异地多活，根据这个路径可以将容灾分为容灾1.0、容灾2.0、容灾3.0三个阶段。\n\n容灾1.0：容灾体系围绕数据建设，多以主-备的方式部署，但备用机房不承担流量，基本上都是单活结构。\n容灾2.0：容灾视角从数据转换为应用系统，业务具有同城双活或同城多活能力，采用同城双活或同城双活加异地冷备（两地三中心）的部署架构，除冷备以外的每个机房都有流量处理能力。\n容灾3.0：以业务为中心，多采用单元化架构，容灾基于单元间的两两互备实现，根据单元的部署位置可以实现同城多活和异地多活。采用单元化架构的应用本身具有很好的容灾能力和扩展能力。\n\n\n由于各公司所处发展阶段不同，采用的方案也会有所区别，美团大部分业务处于2.0阶段（即同城双活或多活架构），但对于大体量、有地域容灾及有地域扩展性要求的业务则处在容灾3.0阶段。下面会介绍一下美团的容灾架构。\n2.2 美团容灾架构\n美团的容灾架构主要包括两种，一种是N+1容灾架构，一种是SET化架构。\nN+1架构：在业界也称散部或者多AZ部署⽅案，将容量为C的系统部署在N+1个机房，每个机房能提供至少C/N的容量，挂掉任何一个机房时，剩余系统仍能支撑C的容量。该方案的核心是把容灾能力下沉到PaaS组件来完成，在出…",

          "description": "01 背景\n1.1 初识混沌工程\n首先我们先了解一下什么是混沌工程？简单而言，混沌工程是在系统上进行实验的技术手段，目的是建立对系统抵御生产环境中失控条件的能力以及信心。这主要体现在两个方面，从系统角度来讲，混沌工程可以提升我们架构的容错能力和韧性，降低故障发生率和复发率，提升系统用户在使用时的体验；从人员角度来讲，通过混沌工程我们可以加深对架构的理解，在处理故障时能提高整体的应急效率，并且能主动去探究系统中潜在的一些问题。\n混沌工程最早可以追溯到2008年，当时奈飞公司（Netflix）因数据库故障造成了一次巨大的损失，于是他们便围绕着稳定性体系做出了一些探索和建设。直到2015年，混沌工程的理念才被奈飞正式的提出。2019年，阿里云推出了开源工具Chaos Blade；2020年，PingCAP开源了Chaos Mesh，这也标志着国内在混沌工程领域也有了成熟的产品。\n\n1.2 现状\n下面是当前美团数据库运维的一些现状，这里从五个维度展开：首先集群规模（包括集群的大小和数量）的线性增长；第二，集群访问量的持续增加，当然这也是美团业务增长的必然结果；第三，线上遇到的故障种类也越来越多；第四，单位时间故障的影响也越来越大；第五，一些小概率事件的发生也随着集群规模的扩大成为了可能。\n\n1.3 痛点&作用\n基于以上的问题，我们整体上对于数据库集群的稳定性要求也越来越高。所以，围绕着稳定性建设，数据库团队在故障的预防、发现、分析、恢复以及事后复盘5个方面做了很多工作。其中在故障预防方面，我们会通过故障演练探索不同故障场景对我们业务的影响，提升故障发生时业务系统整体的容错能力。早期的时候，我们通过人工的方式来做故障演练，但人工演练在以下四个方面存在很大的问题：\n\n\n在演练场景方面，人工演练能演练的场景比较少，演练场景的复杂度也比较高；\n在演练覆盖率方面，人工演练无法覆盖大多数的集群…",
