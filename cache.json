          "description": "1 容灾介绍\n我们通常会把故障分为三大类，一是主机故障，二是机房故障，三是地域故障。每类故障都有各自的诱发因素，而从主机到机房再到地域，故障发生概率依次越来越小，而故障的影响却越来越大。\n容灾能力的建设目标是非常明确的，就是要能够应对和处理这种机房级和地域级的大规模故障，从而来保障业务的连续性。近几年，业界也发生了多次数据中心级别的故障，对相关公司的业务和品牌产生了非常大的负面影响。当前容灾能力已经成为众多IT企业建设信息化系统的必选项。\n\n2 业务容灾架构\n2.1 容灾架构演进\n容灾架构从最早期的单活形态（同城主备）到同城多活形态，再演化到异地多活，根据这个路径可以将容灾分为容灾1.0、容灾2.0、容灾3.0三个阶段。\n\n容灾1.0：容灾体系围绕数据建设，多以主-备的方式部署，但备用机房不承担流量，基本上都是单活结构。\n容灾2.0：容灾视角从数据转换为应用系统，业务具有同城双活或同城多活能力，采用同城双活或同城双活加异地冷备（两地三中心）的部署架构，除冷备以外的每个机房都有流量处理能力。\n容灾3.0：以业务为中心，多采用单元化架构，容灾基于单元间的两两互备实现，根据单元的部署位置可以实现同城多活和异地多活。采用单元化架构的应用本身具有很好的容灾能力和扩展能力。\n\n\n由于各公司所处发展阶段不同，采用的方案也会有所区别，美团大部分业务处于2.0阶段（即同城双活或多活架构），但对于大体量、有地域容灾及有地域扩展性要求的业务则处在容灾3.0阶段。下面会介绍一下美团的容灾架构。\n2.2 美团容灾架构\n美团的容灾架构主要包括两种，一种是N+1容灾架构，一种是SET化架构。\nN+1架构：在业界也称散部或者多AZ部署⽅案，将容量为C的系统部署在N+1个机房，每个机房能提供至少C/N的容量，挂掉任何一个机房时，剩余系统仍能支撑C的容量。该方案的核心是把容灾能力下沉到PaaS组件来完成，在出…",

Carmack，1970-）的程序员，他编写了《DOOM》的主要代码。他原来只是一个辍学生，但是后来变得世界闻名。\n书里讲了一个他的小故事，分享给大家。\n\n卡马克小时候痴迷电脑，跟家人和同学都很疏远。陪伴他的只有一只叫做\"咪子\"（Mitzi）的猫。他编程时，猫就趴在电脑上面。\n\n19岁，他离开家，去另一个州创业，什么都没带，唯一从家里拿走的就是这只猫。它一直陪着他，甚至公司的员工名单里面，他也把这只猫加了进去。\n后来，DOOM 开发最紧张的那段时间，猫的脾气变得暴躁了，经常乱撒尿，卡马克新买的真皮沙发就被它毁了。\n卡马克不想忍了，尽管相陪多年，他还是把咪子送到了动物收容所，从此就不管它了。\n卡马克跟同事解释这个决定：\"咪子对我的生活产生了负面影响。\" 其他人惊讶地说：\"送到动物收容所，这只猫可能会死掉。\" 卡马克不为所动，转过身继续去编程。\n作者说，这个事件反映了卡马克的性格。他只关心他要写的程序，在他眼里，其他都是小事，如果妨碍到他，就必须剔除。\n他不仅这样对待猫，也这样对待朋友和自己。他从不保存自己的照片、资料、早期作品…",
