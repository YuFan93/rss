如何免费使用 ChatGPT
国内媒体每天大量报道 ChatGPT，但是只字不提，它不对中国大陆用户开放。

OpenAI 要求验证手机号，国内的手机都通不过。也就是说，它不希望国内用户使用这个服务。

我们不揣测，它为什么这么做。但是我觉得，媒体不应该隐讳，也不要自嗨，应该直说，ChatGPT 不欢迎中国大陆用户。
当然，不欢迎使用，不等于不能使用。找一个境外手机号码，或者买一个别人的账号，就可以使用 ChatGPT 了。
而且，实际上不必这么麻烦，有很多变通方法，用起来更简单。我的态度一贯是实用主义，不在乎 OpenAI 的政策，只要想用，那就去用，多多了解国外的最新科技，打破技术封锁。
这种想法的程序员，大概很多，否则为什么 ChatGPT 的变通访问方法，像雨后春笋那样冒出来。下面，我来总结一下这些方法，方便大家。
（1）使用替代网站。国外网友搭建了著名的 FreeGPT，向全世界免费开放，不需要账号就能使用。

类似的网站还有 Chat GPT Demo。国内也有很多，搜索"ChatGPT源"就能找到。GitHub 有好几个仓库（1，2，3），收集了几百个中介网址。
（2）使用 Bing Chat。微软的 Edge 浏览器推出了 Bing Chat 功能，集成了 ChatGPT，可以免费聊天，甚至还能生成图片。

麻烦的是它只向美国用户开放。国内用户要使用这个服务，必须全程从美国 IP 地址访问，另外还需要注册…]]></summary>

论文简介：该论文入选焦点论文（Highlight Paper）。近年来，主动领域自适应被提出用于在领域自适应问题中，设计主动学习算法在未标注的目标域数据中选择最有信息量的一小批样本进行标注，来最大化的提升深度学习模型在目标域数据上的性能，达到高效的标注效率。在实际的开放场景中，目标域样本相对于源域数据的可区分度各异，即对于源域上初始化的而言具有不同层次的可迁移性。目前，鲜有工作对可迁移性各异的目标域样本分类讨论，设计高价值样本的采样策略和定制化的领域自适应训练策略。
我们提出了一种分而治之的策略，综合考虑目标域样本与源域数据的差异性，和模型预测的不确定性，来设计主动学习的采样策略，并提出定制化的目标函数来约束具有不同可迁移性的样本子集，进一步实现采样的鲁棒性。实验表明，我们实现了在多种领域自适应场景下的最优性能，包括无监督领域自适应（UDA）、半监督领域自适应（SSDA）和无源域领域自适应（SFDA…]]></summary>

卡马克的猫
推荐一本书《DOOM 启世录》（Masters of Doom），电子游戏名著，2003年在美国出版，第二年就出了中译本。

它详细讲述了电子游戏《DOOM》（毁灭战士）的故事，两个怀揣梦想的青年，如何一步步创造出这个游戏。
写得非常好，翻译得也好。通过它，可以了解游戏行业的内幕，以及程序员的人生。

主人公之一，是一个叫做约翰·卡马克（John D. Carmack，1970-）的程序员，他编写了《DOOM》的主要代码。他原来只是一个辍学生，但是后来变得世界闻名。
书里讲了一个他的小故事，分享给大家。

卡马克小时候痴迷电脑，跟家人和同学都很疏远。陪伴他的只有一只叫做"咪子"（Mitzi）的猫。他编程时，猫就趴在电脑上面。

19岁，他离开家，去另一个州创业，什么都没带，唯一从家里拿走的就是这只猫。它一直陪着他，甚至公司的员工名单里面，他也把这只猫加了进去。
后来，DOOM 开发最紧张的那段时间，猫的脾气变得暴躁了，经常乱撒尿，卡马克新买的真皮沙发就被它毁了。
卡马克不想忍了，尽管相陪多年，他还是把咪子送到了动物收容所，从此就不管它了。
卡马克跟同事解释这个决定："咪子对我的生活产生了负面影响。" 其他人惊讶地说："送到动物收容所，这只猫可能会死掉。" 卡马克不为所动，转过身继续去编程。
作者说，这个事件反映了卡马克的性格。他只关心他要写的程序，在他眼里，其他都是小事，如果妨碍到他，就必须剔除。
他不仅这样对待猫，也这样对待朋友和自己。他从不保存自己的照片、资料、早期作品…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1 容灾介绍
我们通常会把故障分为三大类，一是主机故障，二是机房故障，三是地域故障。每类故障都有各自的诱发因素，而从主机到机房再到地域，故障发生概率依次越来越小，而故障的影响却越来越大。
容灾能力的建设目标是非常明确的，就是要能够应对和处理这种机房级和地域级的大规模故障，从而来保障业务的连续性。近几年，业界也发生了多次数据中心级别的故障，对相关公司的业务和品牌产生了非常大的负面影响。当前容灾能力已经成为众多IT企业建设信息化系统的必选项。

2 业务容灾架构
2.1 容灾架构演进
容灾架构从最早期的单活形态（同城主备）到同城多活形态，再演化到异地多活，根据这个路径可以将容灾分为容灾1.0、容灾2.0、容灾3.0三个阶段。

容灾1.0：容灾体系围绕数据建设，多以主-备的方式部署，但备用机房不承担流量，基本上都是单活结构。
容灾2.0：容灾视角从数据转换为应用系统，业务具有同城双活或同城多活能力，采用同城双活或同城双活加异地冷备（两地三中心）的部署架构，除冷备以外的每个机房都有流量处理能力。
容灾3.0：以业务为中心，多采用单元化架构，容灾基于单元间的两两互备实现，根据单元的部署位置可以实现同城多活和异地多活。采用单元化架构的应用本身具有很好的容灾能力和扩展能力。


由于各公司所处发展阶段不同，采用的方案也会有所区别，美团大部分业务处于2.0阶段（即同城双活或多活架构），但对于大体量、有地域容灾及有地域扩展性要求的业务则处在容灾3.0阶段。下面会介绍一下美团的容灾架构。
2.2 美团容灾架构
美团的容灾架构主要包括两种，一种是N+1容灾架构，一种是SET化架构。
N+1架构：在业界也称散部或者多AZ部署⽅案，将容量为C的系统部署在N+1个机房，每个机房能提供至少C/N的容量，挂掉任何一个机房时，剩余系统仍能支撑C的容量。该方案的核心是把容灾能力下沉到PaaS组件来完成，在出…]]></summary>

黄仁勋的 Nvidia 故事
黄仁勋大概是硅谷最有影响力的华人。

1993年，他跟两个朋友一起创办了芯片设计公司 Nvidia（中文名"英伟达"）。当时是小公司，可现在是美国第五大科技公司（仅次于苹果、微软、谷歌和亚马逊）。
十年前，如果你买了 Nvidia 的股票，现在都要笑死了，因为它上涨了105倍！最近十年美国涨幅第一名的股票就是它。

上周，黄仁勋突然出现在台湾，被拍到在饶河街夜市买小吃。

后来大家才知道，他要参加5月27日的台大毕业典礼，他是今年的演讲嘉宾。

我推荐这个演讲，网上有全文。原文是英语，已经译成中文。
他只讲了20分钟，但是解开了我心中一直的疑问：Nvidia 是怎么发家的。下面就是我根据这个演讲，整理出来的 Nvidia 的故事。
黄仁勋说，为什么要创立 Nvidia？因为我们看好加速计算。
人类对计算速度的要求一定会越来越高，CPU 只能做通用计算，加速计算需要定制的专用硬件，所以我们的创业目标就是加速计算的硬件。
市场需求量最大的加速计算硬件，就是游戏的图形芯片（GPU），所以我们选择游戏显卡作为创业产品。我们只做芯片设计，生产全部外包。
1994年，我们的第一个客户是日本游戏公司 SEGA，我们为它的游戏主机设计显卡。

（图片说明：Nvidia 的第一个产品，SEGA 游戏机的 NV1 显卡。）
但是第二年，微软发布了 Windows 平台的图形接口 Direct3D。我们一下子就慌了，因为它跟我们的设计是冲突的。…]]></summary>
