          "description": "写在前面\nCVPR 全称为 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition，国际计算机视觉与模式识别会议。该会议始于1983年，与ICCV和ECCV并称计算机视觉方向的三大顶级会议。根据谷歌学术公布的2022年最新学术期刊和会议影响力排名，CVPR在所有学术刊物中位居第4，仅次于Nature、NEJM和Science。2023年，CVPR共收到全球9155篇论文投稿，最终2360篇被接收，接收率约为25.78%。\n\n| 01 Divide and Adapt: Active Domain Adaptation via Customized Learning\n论文作者：黄铎峻（中山大学，美团实习生），李继昌（香港大学），陈伟凯（腾讯-美国），黄君实（美团），柴振华（美团），李冠彬（中山大学）\n论文下载：PDF\n\n论文简介：该论文入选焦点论文（Highlight Paper）。近年来，主动领域自适应被提出用于在领域自适应问题中，设计主动学习算法在未标注的目标域数据中选择最有信息量的一小批样本进行标注，来最大化的提升深度学习模型在目标域数据上的性能，达到高效的标注效率。在实际的开放场景中，目标域样本相对于源域数据的可区分度各异，即对于源域上初始化的而言具有不同层次的可迁移性。目前，鲜有工作对可迁移性各异的目标域样本分类讨论，设计高价值样本的采样策略和定制化的领域自适应训练策略。\n我们提出了一种分而治之的策略，综合考虑目标域样本与源域数据的差异性，和模型预测的不确定性，来设计主动学习的采样策略，并提出定制化的目标函数来约束具有不同可迁移性的样本子集，进一步实现采样的鲁棒性。实验表明，我们实现了在多种领域自适应场景下的最优性能，包括无监督领域自适应（UDA）、半监督领域自适应（SSDA）和无源域领域自适应（SFDA…",
